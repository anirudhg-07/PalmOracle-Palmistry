## 📌 Overview

This project is a full-stack web application that accepts a palm image from the user, processes it using **OpenCV** for edge detection and line analysis, and generates **AI-simulated predictions** for personality, career, and love life using rule-based logic.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: This application does **not** perform real palmistry. Predictions are simulated using computer vision techniques and predefined rules for educational purposes.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📤 Upload palm image from browser
- 🔍 Grayscale conversion + edge detection (Canny algorithm)
- 📊 Line density analysis to drive predictions
- 🔮 Predictions across 3 categories: **Love**, **Career**, **Personality**
- 🖼️ View processed (edge-detected) image alongside results
- ⚡ Fast response with loading state feedback

npm install
npm start
```

Frontend runs on **http://localhost:3000**

---

## 📦 Dependencies

### Backend (`requirements.txt`)

```
flask
flask-cors
opencv-python
numpy
```

### Frontend

```
react
axios
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User uploads a palm image via the React UI
2. Image is sent as a `multipart/form-data` POST request to `/analyze`
3. Flask receives the image and passes it to OpenCV
4. OpenCV converts to **grayscale** → applies **Canny edge detection**
5. Line density (ratio of edge pixels to total pixels) is calculated
6. A **rule-based system** maps density ranges to predictions
7. Processed image (base64) + predictions are returned as JSON
8. React renders the results on screen

## 🤖 AI Techniques Used

| Technique | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Computer Vision** | Detect palm lines via edge detection |
| **Rule-Based System** | Map line patterns to personality predictions |
| **Randomization** | Add variation to generated prediction text |

> No deep learning or trained models are used — this project simulates AI behavior using classical image processing.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Predictions are not scientifically or astrologically accurate
- Accuracy depends on image quality and lighting
- Uses fixed rule thresholds, not a trained ML model

---

## 🔭 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Deep learning model for real palm line detection
- [ ] User login and prediction history
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Multilingual support
- [ ] Confidence score for predictions
